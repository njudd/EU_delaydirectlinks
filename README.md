# Direct links to claim EU 261 delay compensation

Airlines have the bad habit of hiding their compensation claim forms. So I thought I'd make a readme with an explanation of under what conditions you can claim compensation with direct links to do so. 
<br>
right now it's a work in progress!

## [Norwegian](https://www.norwegian.com/en/ipr/refund#/expenseclaim?rcategory=DELAY)

## [Ryanair](https://eu261expenseclaim.ryanair.com)

Further barriers
<br>
- The also want a document with your bank information, you can just write it on a sheet of paper and take a photo.
- Ryanair also makes you calculate the amount you are owed on the form.

## [Vueling](https://www.vueling.com/en/we-are-vueling/contact/send-us-a-message?category=10)

## [WOW](https://wowair.co.uk/manage/)

Further barriers
<br>
- They have multiple processes depending on if you have a booking number or the date of the flight, this seems unnecessary and meant to confuse claimants.
